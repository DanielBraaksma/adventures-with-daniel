# Code Louisville Final Project

This is my final project for Code Louisville's May web development course 2.

I love travelling and interacting with people from different countries and cultures. I created this application as a personal travel site to visually tell the story of places I have been to/lived and document future travels.

## Required Features included in this project:

1 * Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external file
You must show us or document where that information is being stored so we can confirm that itâ€™s being saved/persisted

    * User submits a vote for a country recommendation from dropdown page. This is saved to MongoDB and then used to update the bar chart data



2 * Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data

    * Vote data is displayed in bar chart and countries visited is displayed in map

(additional)

3 * JavaScript framework such as React, Angular, Vue, etc

    * Application was built using React

4 * Create a web server with at least one route and connect to it from your application using ExpressJS

    * Server built using Node and Express. There are several routes connected to the application to add / edit voting data and countries traveled data
