                    Hi there, I'm Daniel Braaksma. I love travelling and seeing new places as well as familiar ones. I believe some of the most important lessons I've learned in life are based on exposure to new ideas and different cultures.
                    I had the pleasure of growing up in East Africa, teaching English in Vietnam, and living in the Midwest, USA. I now live in Louisville, KY.
                </p>
                <p>This is my final project for Code Louisville's May web development course 2. I created this application as a personal travel site to visually tell the story of places I have been to/lived and document future travels. It was built with MongoDB, Express, React and Node. It uses several packages as well as "svgMap" JavaScript library by Stephan Wagner. I really enjoyed seeing this project materialize from an idea to an actual application. Overcoming some of the challenges this project presented was especially satisfying and I feel driven to continue learning and building.</p>
